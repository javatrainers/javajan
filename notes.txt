Amazon
	Has-A = variables = memory, store information
	Does-A = methods = processing information
	
Computing device
	cellphone,laptop
	Memory = store information
	CPU = process information
	
vary/varies = change

Variables :
	What is Variable
		container/holds information
		something that changes : information stored in variable are bound to change
	Data types
	Data structure
	Values 
	Declaration rules
	Initialization rules
	Assignment rules
	Rules on Data
		Reading data
		changing data
	Scope of Data
		Data that is part of you or defines you - global
		Data that is provided to you by other - parameter
		Data that u hold on temprory basis - local
	Accessing Data
		Within
		
	
 *********** Declaration rules ***********
	Declration line includes.... Data type followed by variable name
	variable cannot be assigned with a value before declaration a data type
	variable names : same program and same block
		u cannot have 2 similar variable names
		can contain alphabets, numbers, $, _
		start with alphabet or $ or _ 
		coding practice
			naming convention - camelCase
			choose a relevant meaningful names
	
	
******** initialization rules ****
	Value assigned to a variable for the FIRST time.
	values should match the data type on LHS
	RHS can be literal value or variable of same type
	
	

Methods :
	********* Method Declaration	*********
		how to recognize methods : Does-A exercise
		how to code methods :
			What to name this activity ??? <<NAME>>
			how many inputs are required ??? what are the data type of each inputs ???
			how many outputs are required ??? what is the data type of each output ???
		
		PUBLIC 	OUTPUT 	NAME	(INPUT)
	
	
		NAME : similar rules as variables
			Follow camelCase format in method names
			Alphabets , numbers, $, _ allowed in method names
	
		OUTPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or 1 
			0 = void  ... 
				public  void hello(String message)
			1 = appropriate data type, int/boolean... 
				public int add(int a, int b)
			more than 1 = complex or multiple infor to return, create an object data type 
				public Profile display(String userid)
				
		INPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or MORE 
			0 = if no input require, leave it empty
				public int bye(  )
			More = if more than 1 input , separated by comma. data type followed by the name 
				public int add(int number1, int number2)

	********* Method Body - logic/ instructions ********* 
	
		LOGIC : use control flows and operators for logic.
		
		
		RETURN STATEMENT :
		
			if void output - no return required
			if anything but void - return required
				primitive data type - 
					literal value that matches output data type 
						or 
					variable that matches output data type 
				Object /complex data type
					variable that matches output data type
